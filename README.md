# Neural Category Theory Diagrams

This repository contains a collection of diagrams exploring the intersection of neural architectures, category theory, and brain-computer interfaces through the lens of categorical relationships and morphisms.

## Contents

### 1. [Neural Category Diagrams](neural-category.md)
- Basic Neural Morphisms
- Functorial Relationships
- Neural Networks as Presheaves

### 2. [BCI and Neural Wiring](bci-wiring.md)
- Signal Flow Architecture
- Category Theoretical View of BCI
- Neural State Space

### 3. [Ontological Categories](ontological-categories.md)
- E(GG) Ontology Machine
- Ontological Presheaf Structure
- Categorical Evolution

## Diagram Types

The diagrams in this repository use Mermaid.js for visualization and are organized into three main categories:

1. **Structural Diagrams**: Representing the architecture and connectivity patterns of neural networks and their categorical interpretations.

2. **Flow Diagrams**: Illustrating the movement of information and transformations between different categorical spaces.

3. **State Space Diagrams**: Visualizing the evolution and relationships of states in various categorical contexts.

## Key Concepts

- **Categories**: Abstract containers for objects and morphisms that satisfy composition and identity laws
- **Functors**: Structure-preserving mappings between categories
- **Natural Transformations**: Systematic ways to transform between functors
- **Presheaves**: Contravariant functors that help model complex relationships

## Theoretical Framework

The diagrams combine concepts from:
- Category Theory
- Neural Network Architecture
- Brain-Computer Interfaces
- Ontological Engineering

Each diagram type emphasizes different aspects of these intersecting domains while maintaining categorical rigor.

## Usage

These diagrams can be viewed directly on GitHub, which supports Mermaid.js rendering. They can be used for:
- Understanding neural architecture design
- Analyzing categorical relationships in neural systems
- Exploring ontological structures in neural contexts
- Studying BCI system design through a categorical lens
